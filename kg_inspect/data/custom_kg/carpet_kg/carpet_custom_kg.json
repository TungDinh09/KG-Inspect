Order free samplesWhat type of carpet is best? There’s no carpet that’s better than the rest; they all have their pros and cons. It’s a bit like Cinderella’s glass slipper - the best type of carpet is the one that’s the right fit for your home and your needs! The first thing you need to consider is what room the carpet is being fitted in as this will determine what type of carpet you choose. Certain carpets are classed as heavy use so they’re a better option for high traffic areas in your home like stairs and hallways because they’re more hard wearing. Across the different carpet types, you’ll find varying degrees of softness, texture, density, firmness, durability, and stain-resistance – as well as a wide range of price points. There are hundreds of carpet colours to choose between, and all our carpets have a completely unique look depending on the type you choose. For example, a grey saxony carpet is soft and luxurious, whereas a grey Berber carpet feels more rustic and relaxed. A cream twist carpet is perfect for a modern living room, whilst a cream wool loop carpet would work well in the lounge of a period property. The possibilities are endless! There are also a variety of different carpet tog ratings to choose from. Carpet tog is the unit of measurement used to let you know the thermal insulating property of different types of carpet –, how warm it can help to keep your room. Carpet tog rating tends to range from 0.70 to over 3.00 – the higher the tog rating, the better it will retain heat and the warmer your room will be. The type of flooring that you pick will influence the tog rating: the denser and the heavier the weight of the pile of your carpet is, the higher the carpet tog value will be. If you have underfloor heating, you need to take a different approach. As the floor will be warm, you won’t need such a high tog rating with your carpet. Please ask one of our expert floorologists to advise you on the best carpet or flooring to suit your underfloor heating, either in store, one when you book a free home visit.",

High pile carpet features a loop that is snipped higher up, resulting in a soft, plush feel and appearance. Low pile carpet, as you can guess, is cut lower down, leading to a firmer, more durable carpet.

Synthetic fibers are usually made up of one of three materials: nylon, polypropylene or polyester. All three are created by similar chemical processes using oil and natural gas. Nylon leads the way. Almost 75% of carpet today is made of nylon and, compared to the other fibers below, it performs the best overall. Nylon is the leader in: appearance retention, fade and heat resistance, soil and stain resistance, and color and styling.

Wool carpets are prone to shedding, while synthetic fibers are more resistant. Regular vacuuming can manage shedding but excessive vacuuming may exacerbate the problem. 3 Depressions and Indentations: Caused by the weight of furniture compressing the fibers, these depressions can be treated with a damp rag or hot clothes iron. 4 Carpet Buckling: This can be caused by moisture, poor installation, or dragging heavy furniture. Solutions include re-stretching the carpet and using a dehumidifier to manage moisture levels. 5 Fading and Discoloration: Often a result of direct sunlight exposure, fading and discoloration can be mitigated by using blinds or curtains.

Vacuum regularly to prevent dirt matting the carpet fibers. Note that a vacuum fitted with brushes or beater bar should be used on cut pile carpets while a vacuum only should be used on loop pile carpets. Also note that newly laid carpets often shed loose fibers, which is fine. 2 One can save wear and tear on carpet by asking everyone to take off his or her shoes before entering home. 3 When cleaning your carpet, detergents such as washing up liquid and soap should not be used. Instead, reputable carpet care treatments should be used. 4 When dealing with spillages, act swiftly as this will improve the chance of avoiding stains. Liquids should be blotted (not rubbed) using clean white absorbent cloth or kitchen roll, and you should start from the outside of the stain and work inwards. Apply your cleaning agent to the cloth and not the carpet directly, and rinse with water afterwards. Use a hair dryer to dry the area and finish by brushing up the carpet pile. 5 Change air filters in heating and air-conditioning systems as recommended by the manufacture’s directions.

      "content": "It is essential to take specific precautions when cleaning a carpet, especially when it is made of loops or when the material tends to form pills. Here are some explanations regarding best practices: 1 Vacuum Cleaner with Rotating Brush: Using a vacuum cleaner with a rotating brush can damage the loops of a carpet, especially if they are longer or more delicate. Rotating brushes can pull on the loops, stretch them, or even pull them out, resulting in an uneven appearance and deterioration of the carpet over time. It is recommended to use a vacuum cleaner with a soft brush or to disable the rotating brush function when cleaning a looped carpet. 2 Maximum Vacuum Power: Using maximum suction power on a vacuum cleaner can also be harmful to carpets, especially those with loops. Too much suction power can pull out the loops of the carpet or even damage the fibers, thereby reducing the carpet's lifespan. It is better to adjust the vacuum cleaner's suction power to a moderate level for effective cleaning without the risk of damage. 3 Use of a Textile Shaver for Pills: If pills appear on a carpet, using a textile shaver can be an appropriate method to remove them without damaging the rest of the carpet. By gently running the razor over the pills, they can be neatly trimmed without affecting the surrounding loops or other parts of the carpet. It is important to proceed with caution to avoid unintentional cuts in the fibers. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rNlwQiA3u0",

Soiling [] Maintain the beauty of your carpet by cleaning it regularly before it becomes excessively soiled. Dirty, airborne particles may be deposited on carpet, causing dulling. Dulling is caused by the deposits of all types of soil. For example, a delicate rose color may gradually become a neutral taupe because of soil, while light blue may take on a dull, gray-green hue. Red clay soil also can cause a pronounced change in some colors. In spite of such phenomena, the original color of a carpet is not lost; it is still present under the soil. Oily soil may be very difficult to remove after it has been on the carpet for a long time, and it may be actually absorbed into the fiber, causing the carpet to have a yellow cast. Frequent cleanings are important to avoid this problem. Entry mats at doorways trap soil, and combined with routine cleaning and vacuuming, provide extra protection for all floor coverings.",

In the first instance, be mindful of colour, pile and patterns when choosing carpets for each room. Patterned carpets hide a multitude of sins and might be a good choice in children’s and family rooms. Light colours may not be suitable in hallways and staircases if they have a high footfall. Many carpets are dirt and stain resistant which will reduce the problem happening in the first place. Have you ever noticed dark marks on carpets around the edges close to the skirting boards? This is caused by a build-up of dust and might be caused by ill-fitting skirting boards. Similarly, gaps in floorboards and under door frames can cause draughts and will allow dust to travel and cause build-up when it settles. To prevent this from happening, have your carpet supplier check for potential problems before fitting, and once fitted, hoover the edges of your carpet regularly with a slim attachment to remove all dust. Addressing possible carpet problems before fitting is better than trying to find solutions after a stain has occurred. Drink spills and pet soiling are some of the most common carpet problems. These should be treated quickly for the most effective stain removal. Blot the spill with a dry, white cloth using all your weight to take up as much of the spill as possible.",

This does not cause problems if you are having different carpets in each room, or having carpets installed throughout in one go, but if you are updating them one by one you may run into colour matching carpet problems. You need to be aware that you may have slightly different colour shades, even when you are buying the same make of carpet from the same supplier.

The other is when slack yarn gathers during tufting. Sprouting can also occur as a result of variations in yarn tack during the air entangling process. Sprouts commonly develop with cut and loop style carpet. This happens where the carpet changes from cut to loop. At this point, the yarn is pulled closer to the back. This is due to a change in tension. The latex is also starved. Although sprouting loops are usually detected and removed during manufacturing, they can also be removed by clipping after installation. Clipping of high tufts is considered part of the carpet’s normal maintenance program. Clipping will not alter the performance or the warranty of a carpet.",

Berber is considered open loop carpet, which is actually what all carpets start as. Since it is easier to produce, Berber tends to be priced more affordably. Additionally, most Berber is made of Olefin, a much cheaper material than nylon or wool carpeting. Berber carpeting is also a course material, making it quite durable. The open loop structure allows for spills to sit on top of the carpet longer, making it easier for a quick cleanup. These loops, however, are also the downfall of Berber carpeting. They’re easier to “catch” than other materials and may be a concern for households with high pet traffic. If one loop is accidentally snagged, it can cause a “run” and pull up a whole strip of carpeting.",

Here's why it might be recommended to delicately trim what protrudes. While this action can address the immediate problem of loose threads, it is also crucial to identify the underlying cause of the detachment. Variations in humidity can indeed have consequences for the latex used in the manufacturing of a tufted carpet. Latex is often used as a backing to hold the carpet fibers in place. Frequent changes in humidity, especially during floor cleaning or in the presence of excessive water, can lead to latex degradation over time. This can weaken the support and result in a loss of elasticity, compromising the carpet's ability to keep its fibers in place. In high humidity conditions, latex can promote the growth of mold and mildew, further damaging the carpet and creating an unhealthy environment. 2 Flat-Woven Carpets: When threads come loose, there is a risk that it could lead to an \"unraveling\" effect or an extension of the deterioration. For a flat-woven carpet, preventing fraying can be crucial to maintaining its integrity and appearance. Here's how you can reinforce and avoid fraying by making stitches, and this as soon as possible. It is essential to be gentle while stitching to avoid further damage to the carpet fibers. If you are not comfortable with stitching or if the damage insignificant, consider seeking assistance from a professional carpet repair service for specialized advice and repairs. Try to determine why the threads are coming loose. This could be due to causes such as sharp objects, frequently moved heavy furniture, or pets scratching the carpet. 3 Hand-Knotted Carpets: Even for hand-knotted carpets, it is important to understand that while these carpets are generally renowned for their durability and quality, no fiber is truly unbreakable. Avoid placing a hand-knotted carpet in high-traffic areas or subjecting it to excessive stress, such as frequent movement of heavy furniture, to help maintain its quality. If threads come loose from a hand-knotted carpet, it is important to handle the situation with care to prevent further issues. Here's why it might be recommended to delicately trim what protrudes. 4 Binding: The binding of a carpet refers to the finished edge that helps secure the carpet's edges and prevent fraying. Avoiding excessive pulling, regular cleaning, and promptly addressing any loose threads can prevent binding tearing. Carpets in high-traffic areas or under heavy furniture may experience more stress on the binding, increasing the risk of wear and tear. Using a rug pad not only provides additional cushioning but can also help reduce friction between the rug and the floor, minimizing stress on the binding. If there are apparent bricks or irregularities on the floor beneath a rug, it can potentially affect the binding of the rug and certain areas of the rug over time.",

      "content": "It is essential to take specific precautions when cleaning a carpet, especially when it is made of loops or when the material tends to form pills. Here are some explanations regarding best practices: 1 Vacuum Cleaner with Rotating Brush: Using a vacuum cleaner with a rotating brush can damage the loops of a carpet, especially if they are longer or more delicate. Rotating brushes can pull on the loops, stretch them, or even pull them out, resulting in an uneven appearance and deterioration of the carpet over time. It is recommended to use a vacuum cleaner with a soft brush or to disable the rotating brush function when cleaning a looped carpet. 2 Maximum Vacuum Power: Using maximum suction power on a vacuum cleaner can also be harmful to carpets, especially those with loops. Too much suction power can pull out the loops of the carpet or even damage the fibers, thereby reducing the carpet's lifespan. It is better to adjust the vacuum cleaner's suction power to a moderate level for effective cleaning without the risk of damage. 3 Use of a Textile Shaver for Pills: If pills appear on a carpet, using a textile shaver can be an appropriate method to remove them without damaging the rest of the carpet. By gently running the razor over the pills, they can be neatly trimmed without affecting the surrounding loops or other parts of the carpet. It is important to proceed with caution to avoid unintentional cuts in the fibers. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rNlwQiA3u0",

Here's why it might be recommended to delicately trim what protrudes. While this action can address the immediate problem of loose threads, it is also crucial to identify the underlying cause of the detachment. Variations in humidity can indeed have consequences for the latex used in the manufacturing of a tufted carpet. Latex is often used as a backing to hold the carpet fibers in place. Frequent changes in humidity, especially during floor cleaning or in the presence of excessive water, can lead to latex degradation over time. This can weaken the support and result in a loss of elasticity, compromising the carpet's ability to keep its fibers in place. In high humidity conditions, latex can promote the growth of mold and mildew, further damaging the carpet and creating an unhealthy environment. 2 Flat-Woven Carpets: When threads come loose, there is a risk that it could lead to an \"unraveling\" effect or an extension of the deterioration. For a flat-woven carpet, preventing fraying can be crucial to maintaining its integrity and appearance. Here's how you can reinforce and avoid fraying by making stitches, and this as soon as possible. It is essential to be gentle while stitching to avoid further damage to the carpet fibers. If you are not comfortable with stitching or if the damage insignificant, consider seeking assistance from a professional carpet repair service for specialized advice and repairs. Try to determine why the threads are coming loose. This could be due to causes such as sharp objects, frequently moved heavy furniture, or pets scratching the carpet. 3 Hand-Knotted Carpets: Even for hand-knotted carpets, it is important to understand that while these carpets are generally renowned for their durability and quality, no fiber is truly unbreakable. Avoid placing a hand-knotted carpet in high-traffic areas or subjecting it to excessive stress, such as frequent movement of heavy furniture, to help maintain its quality. If threads come loose from a hand-knotted carpet, it is important to handle the situation with care to prevent further issues. Here's why it might be recommended to delicately trim what protrudes. 4 Binding: The binding of a carpet refers to the finished edge that helps secure the carpet's edges and prevent fraying. Avoiding excessive pulling, regular cleaning, and promptly addressing any loose threads can prevent binding tearing. Carpets in high-traffic areas or under heavy furniture may experience more stress on the binding, increasing the risk of wear and tear. Using a rug pad not only provides additional cushioning but can also help reduce friction between the rug and the floor, minimizing stress on the binding. If there are apparent bricks or irregularities on the floor beneath a rug, it can potentially affect the binding of the rug and certain areas of the rug over time.",

Berber is considered open loop carpet, which is actually what all carpets start as. Since it is easier to produce, Berber tends to be priced more affordably. Additionally, most Berber is made of Olefin, a much cheaper material than nylon or wool carpeting. Berber carpeting is also a course material, making it quite durable. The open loop structure allows for spills to sit on top of the carpet longer, making it easier for a quick cleanup. These loops, however, are also the downfall of Berber carpeting. They’re easier to “catch” than other materials and may be a concern for households with high pet traffic. If one loop is accidentally snagged, it can cause a “run” and pull up a whole strip of carpeting.",

Here are some explanations regarding best practices: 1 Vacuum Cleaner with Rotating Brush: Using a vacuum cleaner with a rotating brush can damage the loops of a carpet, especially if they are longer or more delicate. Rotating brushes can pull on the loops, stretch them, or even pull them out, resulting in an uneven appearance and deterioration of the carpet over time. It is recommended to use a vacuum cleaner with a soft brush or to disable the rotating brush function when cleaning a looped carpet. 2 Maximum Vacuum Power: Using maximum suction power on a vacuum cleaner can also be harmful to carpets, especially those with loops. Too much suction power can pull out the loops of the carpet or even damage the fibers, thereby reducing the carpet's lifespan. It is better to adjust the vacuum cleaner's suction power to a moderate level for effective cleaning without the risk of damage. 3 Use of a Textile Shaver for Pills: If pills appear on a carpet, using a textile shaver can be an appropriate method to remove them without damaging the rest of the carpet. By gently running the razor over the pills, they can be neatly trimmed without affecting the surrounding loops or other parts of the carpet. It is important to proceed with caution to avoid unintentional cuts in the fibers. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rNlwQiA3u0",

Vacuum regularly to prevent dirt matting the carpet fibers. Note that a vacuum fitted with brushes or beater bar should be used on cut pile carpets while a vacuum only should be used on loop pile carpets. Also note that newly laid carpets often shed loose fibers, which is fine. 2 One can save wear and tear on carpet by asking everyone to take off his or her shoes before entering home. 3 When cleaning your carpet, detergents such as washing up liquid and soap should not be used. Instead, reputable carpet care treatments should be used. 4 When dealing with spillages, act swiftly as this will improve the chance of avoiding stains. Liquids should be blotted (not rubbed) using clean white absorbent cloth or kitchen roll, and you should start from the outside of the stain and work inwards. Apply your cleaning agent to the cloth and not the carpet directly, and rinse with water afterwards. Use a hair dryer to dry the area and finish by brushing up the carpet pile. 5 Change air filters in heating and air-conditioning systems as recommended by the manufacture’s directions. The more dust and particles remove by the filter, the less that fall on the carpet.",

The primary contributors include: 1 High Traffic and Abrasion: Constant foot traffic and abrasive forces, such as dragging feet or furniture, push debris deeper into the carpet, damaging the fibers. 2 Improper Cleaning: Neglecting regular cleaning can lead to dirt buildup, exacerbating wear and exacerbating the risk of tears. 3 Aging and Exposure: Carpets naturally fade and deteriorate over time, with age and exposure to elements like sunlight hastening this process.",

The more traffic a carpet endures, the more embedded these particles become, causing the fibers to fray and look dull. Carpets age naturally and can fade with exposure to sunlight, both of which are considered normal wear and tear. Escalation to Carpet Deterioration Carpet deterioration is a more severe form of damage, extending beyond simple wear and tear. It includes more frayed fibers, excessive dirt, tears, rips, unraveling material, and stains.",

When this occurs, non-damaging techniques can prevent unnecessary carpet harm. Spike hole sizes range from 1/8 to 1/2 inch in diameter. They appear as single or double holes depending on the stretcher type used. Occasionally, holes may be larger if the backing is torn.",

Impact upon human health: A misperception is that people with asthma and allergies should avoid carpet in the home. Actually, the opposite is true. Studies have shown that properly cleaned carpet helps reduce symptoms and is the best flooring choice for those dealing with asthma and allergies. A carpet has an important role to play in significantly reducing the allergen content of indoor air. Wool, in particular, is known to absorb gaseous toxic pollutants from the atmosphere such as formaldehyde, sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen. The large fiber surface presented by the pile of a carpet allows significant amounts of such pollutants to be absorbed, thereby contributing to improved indoor air quality.",

      "content": "Keywords: Carpet, Flooring, Dust, Resuspension, Indoor microbiology, Indoor chemistry 1. Introduction Carpet constitutes about half of flooring in the United States and is thus prevalent in the indoor environment [1]. Carpet can benefit an indoor space through sound reduction, aesthetics, comfort (both softness and temperature under foot), and injury prevention. It has also received higher comfort ratings compared to solid floors like concrete [2], and in occupational settings, workers who spend 10% of their time standing on hard surface floors compared to soft floors have a 30% increased risk of developing plantar fasciitis [3]. At the same time, use of this material influences indoor environmental quality through impacts on gas-phase air pollutants and particulate matter, including microbiological and chemical components. For example, the mass loading of dust is generally greater in carpets than a comparable area of hardwood floors [4]. The resuspension of particles containing microbes following the physical disturbance of carpets is an important source of human exposure to indoor particles [5,6]. The prevalence of this flooring material dictates the need to better understand the implications of its use in the indoor environment and on sustainability. In this manuscript, we explore questions about the use of carpet related to five general topics: (1) chemistry, (2) microbiology, (3) resuspension and exposure, (4) standards and guidelines, and (5) sustainability (Fig. 1). This report is the result of the workshop “Implications of Carpets on Indoor Chemistry and Microbiology” held on July 30–31, 2019, at The Ohio State University.",

Common factors for selecting carpet as a flooring material may include sound dampening, comfort under foot (including softness and thermal response), injury prevention, aesthetic preferences, stain resistance, strength, durability, and cost. Within the United States, carpet and rugs make up about 54% of the flooring market [16], which is down from 66.9% a decade ago [17]. This downward trend is often attributed to the growing hard surface flooring market, though rug sales have grown with an increase in popularity of hard surface flooring [17].",
