A standard PCB consists of several key layers: **Substrate** – the base material, usually made of FR-4 fiberglass, provides mechanical support and insulation; **Copper Layers** – thin sheets of copper laminated onto the substrate and etched to form the conductive traces; **Solder Mask** – a protective layer applied over the copper traces to prevent short circuits and oxidation, typically green but available in other colors; and **Silkscreen** – the top layer that includes labels, component identifiers, and markings to assist with assembly and troubleshooting. PCBs come in various types, each suited to different applications: **Single-Layer PCBs** have copper traces on one side of the substrate; **Double-Layer PCBs** feature copper traces on both sides for more complex designs; and **Multilayer PCBs** consist of multiple layers of copper and substrate, used in advanced electronics such as smartphones and servers.",

A short 10µs TTL pulse is sent to the Trig pin to start ranging; the module emits an 8-cycle burst of ultrasound at 40kHz, and the Echo pin outputs a signal whose pulse width is proportional to the distance. The distance is calculated using the formula: uS / 58 = centimeters or uS / 148 = inches, or range = high-level time × velocity (340m/s) / 2.

I am trying to figure out if they are dead or not. I bought them around 6-10 months ago, they have had light use over the time I have owned them. My setup: 6 HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors Arduino Mega 2560 Windows 7 Arduino 1.0.5 These sensors have been working well for the past few weeks that they have been in on this project. Today the one quit working, it always returns ~730 cm (works out to about 43 milliseconds). I checked all the wiring, it looked fine, no obvious damage to the sensor itself, I took a multimeter and poked around a bit and compared it to a working one, nothing looked different. I took a working one and swapped it around with the non-working one. The working one worked fine, I let it run for about 5 minutes, and it still worked. The bad one would not work anywhere I connected it. I then connected the non-working sensor to the arduino with all new wiring, it still did not work. About 15 minutes later, another one started doing the same thing, this one had stayed in its spot the whole time. I repeated all the tests again and it was all the same, bad sensor would not work anywhere, and others would work in its place.",

Ask Question Asked 7 years, 11 months ago Modified 7 years, 5 months agoViewed 10k times 2 I am extremely new to Arduino and electrical engineering, and the project I am attempting involves a ultrasonic sensor. I am using the HC-SR04 with the Elegoo Mega2560 Arduino board. A few days ago I was able to print out the distance correctly with an Arduino library, but after adding a h-bridge, 2 motors, and 2 9-volt batteries, the sensor didn't seem to work properly. I went back to a simple circuit with only the HC-SR04, and the distance readouts were all over the place. No matter what, the distance stayed between 90 and 120, mainly staying in the 110s. These numbers seemed to have no correlation with the actual distance. I even tried to calculate the distance myself in case there was something wrong with the library.",

So have I. And after some intensive testing (you'll need a dual beam oscilloscope to see this properly), here's what I've discovered... It suffers from some inherent built-in flaws. One of which is where the receiver picks up the signal from the transmitter before the sound has even 'bounced off' any object at all. Try putting a small tube about 20cm long over either the transmitter or receiver (it doesn't matter which one) to see how this overcomes the problem. The worst problem of all is when the sound waves are reflected off objects that are at oblique angles, and this is particularly worse if they're at some distance away. This results in the most erratic 'Echo' signals imaginable. This could mean your program seems to 'lock up' if you use the 'conventional' way of interfacing to this device. In fact, I understand lots of people have given trying to use the HC-SR04 because they think it's so unreliable. However, here's a program I've written for my Pi Car, which uses the HC-SR04 as the distance sensor. Check out the 'get_distance' function to see how I've overcome all the problems with the sensor. I hope this program is helpful to all you robotics fans out there. Please feel free to comment.",

Joan's graphs are perfect, Doug, and she's made an excellent effort in performing and describing her experiments. My findings are almost exactly the same using an oscilloscope - although I'm working on the principle that sound travels at about 2.95uS per millimetre (not centimetre). The HC-SR04 works just fine if you point it at a large enough object (a wall, for example) that is almost parallel to the sensor, even up to 3 metres away with no obstructions in the way. However, if you alter the angle of the sensor by (say) 30 degrees, the sound will then bounce off the same wall at an oblique angle and head off in a different direction until it manages to bounce off another surface (window, door, alcove, chair, setee, cupboard, floor, ceiling, etc.) which is relatively perpendicular to the receiver. Even at close range (say, 30cm) using a sheet of cardboard. If you tilt the angle of the cardboard sufficiently, the sound will again bounce off at a tangent and only be detected when it returns from another surface that the receiver is in line with. Is any of this this making any sense? I'll have to put a video on YouTube to demonstrate it Electronics... It's what I do! BMS DougPosts:4423Joined: Thu Mar 27, 2014 2:42 pm",

A failure rate that is almost twice the size for larger distances might cause problems since false detections can cause system failures and in turn accidents if used for example in an automated vehicle. The HC-SR04 sensor has a very low failure rate when measuring against a flat wall, illustrated in Figure 4.1b. This might also be due to the smaller FoV for the HC-SR04 sensor. The FoV at 15° makes it easier to aim and only get the desired target object in the measurements. If the target object is smaller than the size of the preferred target object for the sensor at a certain distance, for example during the drinking glass experiment illustrated in Figure 4.2b, an failure occurs. The HC-SR04 sensor does in this case detect the target object but also the surrounding environment. This is shown by a peak at 88 cm representing the wall behind the drinking glass.",

For example, the vis-ible end faces are not always solderable from outside BTC terminals and do not need any soldering in accordance with IPC-A-610 [24]. Further soldering should be avoided simply due to the lack of wetting on the side connection surface. These exclusively cosmetic operations mean an additional heat input into the assembly and create the risk of thermally overloading the com-ponent. Especially since the reworking is often carried out with insufficient tools for convenience. BTCs are typically approved by the component manufacturer for three reflow soldering processes at specified tem-perature time profiles.

There are numerous reasons for reballing: • Switching solder balls from lead-free to lead-based or vice versa, • limited component availability, • prohibitive component cost, • prototyping, • development pattern, • faulty mountings, • filling in missing balls, • Increasing reliability through special com-",

If TEMP pin’s voltage is below 45% or above 80% of supply voltage VIN for more than 0.15S, this means that battery’s temperature is too high or too low, charging is suspended. The temperature sense function can be disabled by grounding the TEMP pin.",

      "content": "The three DfX principles are not independent; they interact to form a comprehensive quality assurance system for the entire PCB production lifecycle: 1 Design for Manufacturability (DFM): The core of DFM is to ensure that the bare board layout meets the manufacturer's process capabilities, thereby achieving a high yield and low cost. This includes designing the board size and shape to maximize panel utilization, using a symmetrical layer stack-up to prevent board warping under thermal stress, and ensuring that trace widths and spacing meet the manufacturer's minimum tolerance requirements. Ignoring DFM can lead to the bare board being scrapped during the manufacturing process due to issues like insufficient annular rings for vias or copper traces being too close, resulting in high cost losses. 2 Design for Assembly (DFA): DFA focuses on the placement and soldering process of components. Its principles require designers to ensure that component spacing, component-to-board edge distance, and pad design all meet the requirements of automated placement machines, thereby avoiding defects such as wrong bit, tin bridge, or missing solder during pick-and-place and reflow soldering processes. For example, correct component polarity marking and consistent component orientation are key to improving the efficiency of automated assembly. 3 Design for Testability (DFT): DFT is a proactive quality strategy that requires designers to reserve test points, test windows, and board edges on the PCB so that electrical tests can be performed quickly and accurately after fabrication and assembly to rapidly diagnose and isolate faults. The lack of a DFT design may mean that even if a functional test (FCT) finds a problem, the specific defect cannot be quickly located, making the debugging and rework process time-consuming and labor-intensive, and possibly leading to the expensive board being scrapped.",

For example, an insufficient annular ring for a via is the main cause of drill breakout and electrical opens. 3 Test Point Design: The design of test point size, spacing, and location must meet the requirements of ICT or flying probe test fixtures.

In a BJT transistor, these are named the emitter (or negative lead), the base (which enables the transistor to function) and the collector (or positive lead). The small current at one terminal is used to generate a larger current at the remaining terminals. In an FET transistor, these terminals are named drain, gate and source. A transistor also contains two PN junctions. In the case of a BJT transistor, these consist of a collector-base junction that is reverse-biased and an emitter-base junction that is forward-biased.",

When VBE becomes lower than this on voltage, the BJT turns off. As this collector-emitter voltage VCE approaches zero, the DC current gain hFE of the BJT decreases. However, because the mutual conductance (gm: change in collector current with respect to change in voltage between the base and emitter) of the BJT is large, it is not practical to apply a voltage directly to the base and control it with voltage. In the circuit shown in Fig. 3, a base resistor is inserted and the voltage applied to the base terminal is converted into a current. It is controlled by the change in this current. There is also a bias resistor built-in transistor (BRT, Fig. 4) that has an external resistor built in and is intended for switching purposes.",

      "content": "Fig. 9 Current flow when IGBT is on 1 Insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBT) An IGBT is a device in which a p-layer is added to the drain (n-layer) of an N-ch MOSFET to form a collector. The equivalent circuit is the circuit enclosed in a red frame in the bias circuit in Fig. 9. A diagram of the equivalent circuit overlaid on the structure diagram is also shown. In this way, the input section has a MOSFET structure with fast switching and low drive current, and the output section has a BJT structure that allows high current and high voltage resistance. In other words, while taking advantage of the advantages of MOSFETs, the weak point of on-resistance is improved by using the conductivity modulation effect of bipolar devices. This realizes a device that is faster than BJTs and has higher voltage resistance and lower on-resistance than MOSFETs. As shown in Fig. 9 bias circuit, a voltage VGE is applied between the gate (G) and emitter (E), and a voltage VCE is applied between the collector (C) and emitter (E). At this time, if VGE is equal to or higher than the threshold value of the N-ch MOSFET, the built-in MOSFET turns on, a drain current ID flows, and the IGBT turns on. The IC current of the PNP transistor in Fig. 9 equivalent circuit is configured so that it hardly flows, and most of the current flows from the emitter of the PNP transistor to the gate. When the PNP transistor is on, the emitter of the PNP transistor (C in IGBT) supplies holes, which are majority carriers, to the N-layer (base of the PNP transistor). At the same time, electrons are also supplied from the N-layer (E in the IGBT) through the MOSFET to maintain electrical balance. As a result, the N-layer has a large number of holes and free electrons, which increases the conductivity and improves the on-resistance. This is called the conductivity modulation effect. When VGE falls below the threshold of the N-ch MOSFET, it turns off. However, a current called a tail current flows for a certain period of time before the IGBT turns off. This is due to the conductivity modulation effect, which reduces the on-resistance when on.",

Cybord’s software analyzes these images for visual quality features, identifying issues like damage, corrosion, and structural irregularities, ensuring each component meets robustness and reliability standards. 2 Top Side Analysis: The AOI machine captures images of the assembled board from the top side. Cybord analyzes these images, inspecting markings and identifiers to ensure clarity, accuracy, and compliance with industry standards.",

Jul 26, 2024 Leave a message 1, Physical factors 1. Overvoltage and overcurrent Overvoltage and overcurrent are the most common physical factors causing transistor damage. When the voltage or current borne by a transistor exceeds its rated value, it can cause serious consequences such as PN junction breakdown, metallization layer burning, or lead wire breakage. Overvoltage may be caused by external factors such as lightning strikes, electrostatic discharge, and power fluctuations, while overcurrent may be caused by unreasonable circuit design, load short circuits, or overload. 2. Temperature High temperature is another important cause of transistor aging and damage. Transistors generate heat during operation. If the heat dissipation is poor or the ambient temperature is too high, it can lead to an increase in the internal temperature of the transistor, which in turn accelerates material aging, reduces performance, and may cause thermal breakdown. On the contrary, extreme low-temperature environments may also have adverse effects on transistors, such as affecting carrier mobility. 2, Chemical factors 1. Corrosion The metalized layer and pins on the surface of transistors are easily corroded by chemicals in the environment, such as moisture, acid and alkali gases, salt spray, etc. These chemicals can react with metals, causing corrosion, oxidation, and even fracture, thereby affecting the electrical performance and mechanical strength of transistors. 2. Pollution Dust, oil and other pollutants in the air may also adhere to the surface of transistors, forming a conductive film or an insulation layer that hinders heat dissipation. These pollutants not only affect the heat dissipation effect of transistors, but may also cause faults such as short circuits and leakage. 3, Mechanical factors 1. Mechanical stress Transistors may be subjected to mechanical stress during installation, transportation, or use, such as vibration, impact, bending, etc. These mechanical stresses may cause looseness, breakage, or pin bending of internal components in transistors, thereby affecting their electrical connections and performance stability. 2. Packaging damage The packaging of a transistor serves as its protective barrier, but it may also be damaged by external factors. Aging, cracking, and deformation of packaging materials can lead to packaging failure, causing the transistor to lose protection and be damaged. 4, Electrical factors 1. Electrostatic discharge (ESD) Electrostatic discharge is one of the common causes of transistor damage. In dry environments, people, clothing, equipment, etc. may carry static electricity. When these objects with static electricity come into contact with the transistor, they will instantly release a large amount of charge, causing the PN junction inside the transistor to break down or the metallized layer to burn out. 2. Electromagnetic interference (EMI) Electromagnetic interference can also have adverse effects on transistors. Strong electromagnetic fields can interfere with the normal working state of transistors, leading to signal distortion, increased noise, and even functional failure.",

If piping is subject to critical level of internal pressure, it reaches the plastic state first on the internal surface, from where it propagates towards the outer surface. The collapse usually occurs before the plastic deformation reaches the outer surface. In the region of highest applied circumferential stess voids and microcracks are formed. Their coalescence eventually leads to a rupture of the piping along the main piping axis.",

In addition, during the service life of aircraft structures, the extent of the damage in the composite structure may gradually increase owing to various environmental factors, such as load, vibration, and hygrothermal conditions. For example, delamination damage occurs in the interior of composites during service, the generation and propagation of which are not visible. This damage adversely affects the mechanical properties of aircraft structures. If the occurrence and accumulation of damage cannot be detected in time, catastrophic failure of aircraft structures may occur, thus endangering human life. Over the past 30 years, research on the damage detection of composite materials in specific fields has focused on crack damage detection [12], determination of bonding quality in laminated plates [13], large-scale thin- or thick-walled structures [14], intelligent structures [15], and sandwich structures [16], [17].",

During the reflow soldering process, the PCB assembly may suffer excessive warpage. Therefore, in order to avoid such a failure, this paper conducts the finite element simulation of the PCB assembly temperature change and the deformation process according to a theoretical model for heat transfer and then explores the causes of warpage and predicts the percentage of warpage that occurs during the reflow soldering. A reliability sensitivity analysis is creatively applied in the PCB assembly warpage study in order to uncover the quantitative influence of multiple factors with random errors on warpage. Moreover, the reliability calculation provides a theoretical basis for the allowable error range of geometric dimensions, material properties and process parameters of the PCB assembly. This research has a remarkable significance and is valuable to engineering in promoting quality and reliability, and increasing the yield of PCB assembly in mass production.Schematic diagram of the heat transfer during the reflow soldering. … Loading process of the moving heat source on the PCB assembly. … Temperature distribution of the PCB assembly during the reflow soldering.
