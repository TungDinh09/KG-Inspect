The patterns consist of interlocking shapes, typically resembling elongated ovals, diamonds, or hexagons, arranged uniformly to create a cohesive design. Each element of the pattern appears to have a slight three-dimensional quality, often characterized by raised or embossed features that enhance the visual texture. The color schemes are primarily monochromatic, with variations in shading that contribute to the material's depth and contour without indicating any defects.\n The overall structures are intact with no visible breaks, distortions, or irregularities that suggest anomalies. Any minor variations in texture or shading are consistent with the inherent properties of the materials and lighting conditions, and do not disrupt the expected uniformity of the patterns. Consequently, all observed characteristics conform to standard quality expectations, confirming that the objects are defect-free and represent normal material conditions.",

Other design considerations are the size and angles of the shapes, which will also affect how well the metal absorbs energy and where the energy is spread throughout the expanded metal.[ 2 ] For the diamond shape, there are at least four different angles that come into account, the two acute and two obtuse angles.[ 3 ] The larger the angles, the less strength the shape will have because there would be too much space inside the shape. However, if the angles are too small, strength is lost because the shape is too close together, so there is no space for the structure to hold.",

The many small openings in the material allow flow through of air, water, and light, while still providing a mechanical barrier to larger objects.

      "content": "Expanded metal mesh is, in fact, widely used for facades due to its strength, flexibility, and aesthetic appeal. It offers a modern, textured look, while also providing functional benefits like natural ventilation, sun shading, and durability. Key benefits for facades 1 Aesthetic appeal. Expanded metal mesh creates a striking visual effect, adding texture and depth to a building’s exterior. The pattern can give the facade a dynamic, modern look that changes with light and angle. 2 Natural ventilation. The open pattern allows air to flow through the facade, which helps improve ventilation inside the building. This makes it a popular choice for structures needing airflow, such as parking garages, sports arenas, or industrial buildings. 3 Sun shading and energy efficiency. Expanded metal mesh acts as a sunshade, reducing direct sunlight and helping to lower interior temperatures. This shading effect improves energy efficiency, reducing cooling costs and providing added comfort. 4 Durability and low maintenance. Expanded metal facades are highly durable and resistant to weather conditions. They are made from materials like aluminium, stainless steel, or coated steel, which are corrosion-resistant and require minimal maintenance. 5 Sustainability. Expanded metal mesh is often made from recyclable materials and uses minimal metal due to its manufacturing process. It can also support energy-saving efforts by reducing the need for artificial cooling, making it an environmentally friendly choice.",

      "content": "The angle in which the shapes are laid also plays a significant role. If the angle is zero, the ends of the shape point to the start and the end of the sheet, making straight lines across the sheet of diamonds. This option provides the most strength when it comes to compressing the sheet on its side. This can even take more pressure than a solid piece of metal because the sheet will compress and spread the pressure throughout the sheet.[ 3 ] The other four commonly used angles are 60°, 90°, 90° plus 60°, and 60° plus 90°. A 60° angle puts the diamond diagonal at the start and end to the sheet. A 90° angle makes the diamond vertical to the start and the end of a sheet.[ 3 ] The 90° plus 60° and 60° plus 90° angles combine both a 60° angle and a 90° angle; the order of the angles is respective to the order in naming. The expanded metal can be manufactured and supplied as standard mesh; or it can be flattened by further levelling processes to have a smooth surface, which allows usage of mesh in more applications, such as prisons, as it no longer has sharp edges that could cause injury.",

      "content": "EXPLORE OUR PROJECTS Does expanded metal rust? Expanded metal can rust, depending on the type of metal used and its exposure to moisture and environmental conditions. Here’s how it varies by material: 1 Steel expanded metal. Standard carbon steel is prone to rust if it’s exposed to moisture or humid environments. To prevent rust, steel expanded metal is often coated with protective finishes, like galvanised or powder coatings, which create a barrier against corrosion. Galvanised expanded metal, in particular, has a zinc coating that provides long-term resistance to rust. 2 Stainless steel expanded metal. Stainless steel is highly resistant to rust and corrosion due to its chromium content, which forms a protective oxide layer. It’s a good choice for applications exposed to harsh weather, marine environments, or chemicals. However, it can still corrode under extreme conditions, like saltwater exposure, without proper maintenance. 3 Aluminium expanded metal. Aluminium does not rust because it doesn’t contain iron, but it can oxidise. Aluminium oxidation creates a protective layer that shields the metal underneath, which actually helps it resist further corrosion. This makes aluminium expanded metal suitable for outdoor applications.",

This patina gives CorTen an earthy look, which changes over time, adding a dynamic, aged quality to buildings and structures. Benefits of CorTen expanded metal 1 The rusted patina of CorTen steel develops with exposure to weather. It changes from orange-brown to deep bronze, then dark brown. This warm, natural look works well in both modern and rustic designs. 2 The patina acts as a protective layer, reducing further rusting. This resistance to corrosion makes CorTen ideal for outdoor applications, where standard steel would need frequent maintenance. 3 Unlike standard steel, CorTen does not need regular paint or coatings. The patina forms naturally and renews itself, saving time and cost on maintenance. 4 CorTen expanded metal has strong load-bearing capabilities. It combines durability with the unique weathering effect of CorTen steel, making it suitable for facades, screens, and structural use. 5 CorTen steel is fully recyclable. Its durability and low maintenance needs also make it an eco-friendly choice with less environmental impact.",

Other design considerations are the size and angles of the shapes, which will also affect how well the metal absorbs energy and where the energy is spread throughout the expanded metal.[ 2 ] For the diamond shape, there are at least four different angles that come into account, the two acute and two obtuse angles.[ 3 ] The larger the angles, the less strength the shape will have because there would be too much space inside the shape. However, if the angles are too small, strength is lost because the shape is too close together, so there is no space for the structure to hold.",

Other design considerations are the size and angles of the shapes, which will also affect how well the metal absorbs energy and where the energy is spread throughout the expanded metal.[ 2 ] For the diamond shape, there are at least four different angles that come into account, the two acute and two obtuse angles.[ 3 ] The larger the angles, the less strength the shape will have because there would be too much space inside the shape. However, if the angles are too small, strength is lost because the shape is too close together, so there is no space for the structure to hold.",

The other benefit to expanded metal is that the metal is never completely cut and reconnected, allowing the material to retain its strength.[ 1 ] History [edit] The inventor and patentee of expanded metal is John French Golding, whose first British patent was issued in 1884. He forged partnerships with Hartlepool industrialists Mathew Gray, Christopher Furness and Robert Irving Jr., who, together with W.B Close, brought the manufacture of expanded metal to Hartlepool. The Expanded Metal Company Limited of Hartlepool, United Kingdom, remains a manufacturer of expanded metal to this day and is one of the largest employers locally.",

However, few studies reported the specific dielectric strength under various electrodes and partial discharge (PD) decomposition products detection of applying the eco-friendly gas in GIS. In this paper, the insulation properties among C4F7N/CO2 mixtures, dry air and CO2 were explored under the reduced-scale gas-insulated experimental device. The relationship between AC breakdown voltage and gas pressure was gained under the different electrodes and gap distances, and 0.6 MPa 7% C4F7N/93% CO2, 0.9 MPa dry air, 0.9 MPa CO2 all possess the capacity to be the insulating medium in eco-friendly gas insulated switchgear. Furthermore, the partial discharge experimental was also carried out to realize the decomposition products detection of dry air, which designs three common defect types including metal protrusion defects, air gap defects, and metal contamination defects. The decomposition products detection result shows that the contains of CO2, CO, and NO2 linearly increase with the increasing applied voltages and times, and the partial discharge defects are distinguished according to the ratios of c(CO2 + CO)/c(NO2) and c(CO2)/c(CO). The results can provide the basis for the further development of eco-friendly gas insulated switchgear.",

Gaitens, Katherine S. Squibb, Melissa A. McDiarmid, and Christine E. Kasper ABSTRACT The continued evolution of military munitions and armor on the battlefi eld, as well as the insurgent use of improvised explosive devices, has led to embedded fragment wounds containing metal and metal mixtures whose long-term toxico-logic and carcinogenic properties are not as yet known. Advances in medical care have greatly increased the survival from these types of injuries. Standard surgical guidelines suggest leaving embedded fragments in place, thus individuals may carry these retained metal fragments for the rest of their lives. Nursing profes-sionals will be at the forefront in caring for these wounded individuals, both immediately after the trauma and during the healing and rehabilitation process. Therefore, an understanding of the potential health effects of embedded metal fragment wounds is essential. This review will explore the history of embedded fragment wounds, current research in the fi eld, and Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs guidelines for the identifi cation and long-term monitoring of individuals with embedded fragments.",

      "content": "Figure 10Decomposition products detection under air gap defect. Full size imageAs shown in Figure 11a, CO2 concentration is positively related to the applied voltage and discharge time. The metal contamination defect is located along the surface of the epoxy resin insulator, and the C elements is easily excited by strong ionized discharge, which also combine with the O atom to form CO and CO2. On the other hand, CO reacts with the sufficient strongly oxidizing O3 to form CO2, which also causes the increase of CO2 concentration. In addition, the partial discharge generated by metal contamination defect occurs along the surface of epoxy resin insulator, which provides continuous C elements under the high voltage field, thus the saturation phenomenon is not obvious. As for CO concentration in Figure 11b, it has a faster growth rate at the initial stage and a decreasing growth rate at the later stage, which gradually approach saturation stage. Moreover, CO2 and CO contamination under metal contamination defect on the insulator surface are much lower than those under air gap defects. The partial discharge under contamination defect only occurs on the surface of epoxy resin, while the partial discharge under air gap defect develops through the entire epoxy resin, which leads to more severe deterioration of insulation materials and excitation of more C atoms. As shown in Figure 11c, the variation trend of NO2 concentration also follows the same growth trend as the air gap defect, but it is higher than that under air gap defects. The gas production rate of NO2 shows a nearly linear increase in the first 4 h. In the initial stage, the volume fraction of NO2 is approximately proportional to the partial discharge time because of the stable partial discharge. The N2 and O2 molecules are collided with the accelerated charged particles, while N atoms and O atoms are generated. Then, N atoms react with O, O2 and O3 under the oxidative reaction to produce NO and NO2. With the partial discharge time increasing, NO2 would be oxidized and consumed by enough O3, which generates NO3 and N2O5, and the gas production rate of NO2 also begins to decrease due to the saturation of the volume fraction. Although NO3 and N2O5 are chemically unstable and a part of NO3 and N2O5 would further decompose into NO and NO2, the gas consumption rate of NO2 keeps on increasing. When the gas production rate and gas consumption rate reaches the balance, the NO2 concentration shows a trend of saturation growth.",

      "content": "Decomposition products generation mechanism In fact, the decomposition products of dry air is generated through collision ionisation, thermal ionisation and other processes under partial discharge, and the various generated particles would be further reacted and restored to gas molecules or other decomposition products, which lead to make changes in the components of insulation medium. The basic chemical properties of dry air are calculated by density functional theory31,32, and the decomposition paths of different elements are analysed by thermodynamic parameters. As shown in Fig. 6, the energy variation and products generation in the process are illustrated, which also contains the main reactions through partial discharge process. The initial process of the reaction is under the action of the local electric field exciting charged particles or free electrons, which accelerate the collision of O2 and N2 molecules and make single O and N atoms. O atoms are easy to achieve many reactions with other elements, and O3 would be produced O atoms and O2 molecules reacted. On the other hand, N atoms react with O, O2 and O3 under the oxidative reaction to produce NO and NO2, while NO possesses strong chemically reactive, and the reaction products are mainly forming to NO2. When the organic materials or solid insulating materials involves in partial discharge process, the C elements excited by strong ionized discharge would also combine with the O atom to form CO and CO2. Due to the strong oxidising property of O3, CO is not the final product under the reaction process, and the content of CO2 product is higher than CO. Therefore, CO, CO2 and NO2 could exist stably in the dry air, and are closely related to the characteristics of partial discharge, which would be used as characteristic gases of partial discharge detection.",

      "content": "Figure 12Decomposition products detection under metal protrusion defect. Full size imageBased on the above result, the defect identification could be accomplished. NO2 is formed by the recombination of N and O atoms produced by electron collision with N2 and O2, and its concentration is directly related to the electric field distribution under different defect types. Therefore, c(NO2) can directly reflect the total decomposition of dry air. On the other hand, The C atoms in CO2 and CO generated by partial discharge under air gap defect and metal contamination defect on insulator surfaces, while c(CO2 + CO) represents the decomposition degree of insulation materials. Considering the difference between the decomposition of dry air and the decomposition degree of insulation material under different defect types, c(CO2 + CO)/c(NO2) ratio and c(CO2)/c(CO) ratio are used as characteristics for diagnosing and evaluating defects which is illustrated in Fig. 13. Under air gap defect, c(CO2)/c(CO) has the relative concentrated distribution, which is mainly in the range of 1 to 4. As for c(CO2 + CO)/c(NO2), it commonly exceeds 9. Under metal contamination defect, c(CO2)/c(CO) and c(CO2 + CO)/c(NO2) are in the range of 1 to 13 and 1 to 9, respectively. Besides, the distribution area possesses the vertical growth along the c(CO2 + CO)/c(NO2) axis for the air gap defect, while it is the horizontal growth along the c(CO2)/c(CO) axis for the metal contamination defect. Metal protrusion defects would be diagnosed by the small quantity near coordinate origin. It can be observed that the selection of two characteristic quantities has the good effect on the distinction of different defect types. The intensity of partial discharge may cause a certain degree of dispersion in the distribution under the same defect type. Adopting two characteristics through the ratio method eliminates the influence of single absolute numerical value, which better reflects the relative changes in decomposition products under different defect types.",

      "content": "EXPLORE OUR PROJECTS Does expanded metal rust? Expanded metal can rust, depending on the type of metal used and its exposure to moisture and environmental conditions. Here’s how it varies by material: 1 Steel expanded metal. Standard carbon steel is prone to rust if it’s exposed to moisture or humid environments. To prevent rust, steel expanded metal is often coated with protective finishes, like galvanised or powder coatings, which create a barrier against corrosion. Galvanised expanded metal, in particular, has a zinc coating that provides long-term resistance to rust. 2 Stainless steel expanded metal. Stainless steel is highly resistant to rust and corrosion due to its chromium content, which forms a protective oxide layer. It’s a good choice for applications exposed to harsh weather, marine environments, or chemicals. However, it can still corrode under extreme conditions, like saltwater exposure, without proper maintenance. 3 Aluminium expanded metal. Aluminium does not rust because it doesn’t contain iron, but it can oxidise. Aluminium oxidation creates a protective layer that shields the metal underneath, which actually helps it resist further corrosion. This makes aluminium expanded metal suitable for outdoor applications.",

      "content": " Toxic Embedded Fragment Surveillance Center The widespread insurgent use of IEDs in Iraq and Afghanistan has resulted in a large number of personnel suffering from blast effects. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been described as the “signature wound” of these confl icts (Hoge et al., 2008). Often overlooked is the fact that, in many of these cases, embedded fragment wounds will occur simultaneously, either from projectiles related to the IED itself, pieces of the destroyed vehicle, or other surrounding materials. IEDs often contain a heterogeneous assortment of material whose in vivo bioki-netic and toxicologic properties are not known. This, along with the laboratory research results discussed previously, raises concern that these types of embed-ded fragments could lead to adverse health effects, both localized and systemic. In response, the DVA established the Toxic Embedded Fragment Surveillance Center in 2008 (http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/toxic_fragments/ surv_center.asp). Because of the success of the Depleted Uranium Follow-Up Program, the Toxic Embedded Fragment Surveillance Center was also estab-lished at the VA Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland.",

Every 2 years, this cohort is invited to Baltimore VA Medical Center where evalu-ations have included physical exams and complete histories covering medical, social, family, partner, and reproductive issues as well as occupational exposures. In addition, extensive laboratory assessments of hematological parameters, serum and urine chemistries, neuroendocrine status, semen analysis, and renal func-tion have been conducted. Samples of blood and urine have been collected for uranium analysis. Mutations and chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes have been assessed. Testing for neurocognitive function has been undertaken, and focus group/risk communication sessions have been conducted. To provide a high level of transparency, group data from these assessments are routinely published in the peer-reviewed medical literature (McDiarmid et al., 2009; McDiarmid, Engelhardt, et al., 2007; McDiarmid et al., 2006; McDiarmid et al., 2004; McDiarmid et al., 2000; McDiarmid, Squibb, et al., 2007; McDiarmid et al., 2001; Squibb et al., 2012). The effort of this program was later expanded to include veterans from Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). In addition, the program offers urine uranium analysis for any veteran who requests it and can provide assistance to primary care providers in interpreting results and answering questions related to DU exposure. The pro-cedures pertaining to this service are found on the DVA website (http://www .publichealth.va.gov/exposures/depleted_uranium/followup_program.asp).",

      "content": " Several factors come into play when attempting to judge the risk from embedded metal fragments. Most obvious is the identity of the metal or metals themselves. Related to this is the bioavailability of the components of the frag-ments (Yokel, Lasley, & Dorman, 2006). Highly soluble metals have the potential to produce systemic toxicity as well as induce organ-specifi c effects, whereas this is not a primary issue with insoluble metals (Emond & Kalinich, 2012). In many cases, the solubilized metals are excreted in the urine, making urinary metal analysis an important tool in identifying embedded metal fragments (Kalinich, Vergara, & Emond, 2008). Reactions at the surface of the embedded fragment can produce reactive oxygen or nitrogen species, resulting in local tissue damage and potentially initiating cell transformation pathways leading to carcinogenesis (Thomsen & Gretzer, 2001). In other cases, this damage remains localized and a fi brous capsule forms around the fragment.",

They have been a potential battlefi eld injury since the invention of gunpowder. However, because of the ballistic properties of the ammunition used in early weapons, most inju-ries resulted in death or traumatic amputation (Manring, Hawk, Calhoun, & Andersen, 2009). It was not until the development of the full metal–jacketed bullet around the time of the Spanish–American War that the survivability from battle wounds improved and the probability of embedded metal fragments increased (Dougherty & Eidt, 2009). The health risk of embedded fragments was considered low because they were considered to be inert once in the body. However, there began appearing in the scientifi c literature occasional reports on medical issues associated with embedded fragment wounds (Eylon et al., 2005; Knox & Wilkinson, 1981; Ligtenstein, Krijnen, Jansen, & Eulderink, 1994; Lindeman, McKay, Taubman, & Bilous, 1990; Schenck & Kronman, 1977; Symonds, Mackay, & Morley, 1985). In most cases, these wounds were suffered during wartime many years prior to the manifestation of the adverse health effect and, in all cases, the fragment was not characterized. However, other reports describing health problems associated with retained metal frag-ments did analyze the excised fragment, and in most cases, it was identifi ed as lead (Akhtar, Funnye, & Akanno, 2003; Coon, Miller, Shirazi, & Sullivan, 2006; Farrell, Vandevander, Schoffstall, & Lee, 1999; John & Boatright, 1999; McQuirter et al., 2004; McQuirter et al., 2001; Nguyen et al., 2005; Rehani & Wissman, 2011). In addition, in many of these cases, a viscous lead- containing liquid was found around the embedded fragment suggesting that, once in the body, many metals can solubilize and become systemic. Health issues with embedded fragments are not limited to lead bullets. Two recent reports describe granuloma formation resulting from embedded fragments of a chainsaw and lawnmower blade, respectively (Osawa et al., 2006; Saruwatari et al., 2009). Various metals comprised both the chain saw and lawnmower blades, but the primary component was tungsten. Even surgically implanted metal-containing medical devices can result in adverse health effects as was seen recently with cobalt and chromium release from metal-on-metal hip replacements (Keegan, Learmonth, & Case, 2007). In the group of veterans wounded by fragments of DU in the First Gulf War, although the fragments continually solubilize over time releasing uranium, no adverse health effects have been documented for the 20 or more years these fragments have been in place (McDiarmid et al., 2009; McDiarmid et al., 2007; McDiarmid et al., 2006; McDiarmid et al., 2004; McDiarmid et al., 2000; McDiarmid, Squibb, Engelhart, Gucer, & Oliver, 2007; McDiarmid et al., 2001).",

Standard surgical guidelines suggest leaving embedded fragments in place except for certain circumstances. These recommendations attempt to balance the potential long-term health risk of the embedded fragment with the risk of morbidity which extensive surgery brings. Adding to this dilemma is the fact that as a result of advances in vehicle armor and weapons design and the insurgent use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), the list of metals and metal mixtures which may be found as embedded fragments is practically endless. Furthermore, little if anything is known about the toxicologic and carcinogenic effect of these materials when found as embed-ded fragment wounds. As a result, the issue of embedded metal fragments has become a primary concern both within the DOD and the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA). This chapter will review some of the experimental data on embed-ded metal fragments, current DOD and DVA policy for long-term monitoring of personnel with these injuries, and critical shortcomings in our knowledge on the effects of embedded metal fragments.",

These concerns lead to the release of Health Affairs Policy Memo 07-029 (Policy on Analysis of Metal Fragments Removed from Department of Defense Personnel; 2007). The long-term risk from the expanded use of novel metal mixtures on the battlefi eld was addressed in the directive. The metals listed in Table 4.1 are designated to be of special concern if found in embedded fragments. Although the decision to surgically remove embedded fragments remains that of the medical personnel, once a fragment is excised, it becomes property of the U.S. Government. They are not to be disposed of or returned to the patient as a “souvenir.” The policy memo further directs that the fragments are to be sent to a service-designated analytical laboratory for identifi cation with the results of the analysis entered into the individual’s medical record as well as in the newly established DOD Embedded Metal Fragment Registry. Occasionally, embedded fragments work their way out of the body over time. If this occurs, patients should retain and pass these fragments on to their primary care providers who should then submit them for analysis.

The SIP with Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) foam core can be sandwiched by either Oriented Strand Board (OSB) or Magnesium Oxide (MgO) board. In extreme wind event, modular building envelop made of SIP might be subjected to windborne debris impact, which might create dominant openings and cause internal pressurization. Therefore, the Australian Wind Standard (AS/NZS 1170.2:2011) specifies that wall and roof should meet with the requirement of impact resistance. In the present study, two types of SIPs made of OSB and MgO board as structural skins were tested on their impact resistance performances by using an air cannon testing system. One or two layers of steel wire mesh were inserted into the structural insulated panel as reinforcement interlayer. Its effec-tiveness on improving the impact resistance capacity was examined by comparing damage mode, residual velocity of the projectile and kinetic energy loss of the projectile.",

Part-to-part variation, part fixturing issues, dispensing materials property variation, dispensing equipment limitations, and robot programming imperfections make dispensing a very difficult process to control. It is very common to see manufacturing engineers tweaking the process on a daily basis just to make it work, especially in automotive body shops. The common deviations from a desired dispensing process are: 1) not enough material; 2) too much material; or 3) incorrect location. Typical quality concerns for not enough material are like structural rigidity, corrosion, leakage, or heat accumulation. Squeeze-out, contact resistance variation for weld-bond, down-stream contamination, and material waste are the common quality issues with too much dispensing material. Incorrect location could potentially trigger all these concerns mentioned above.",

Full size imageAs shown in Figure 11a, CO2 concentration is positively related to the applied voltage and discharge time. The metal contamination defect is located along the surface of the epoxy resin insulator, and the C elements is easily excited by strong ionized discharge, which also combine with the O atom to form CO and CO2. On the other hand, CO reacts with the sufficient strongly oxidizing O3 to form CO2, which also causes the increase of CO2 concentration. In addition, the partial discharge generated by metal contamination defect occurs along the surface of epoxy resin insulator, which provides continuous C elements under the high voltage field, thus the saturation phenomenon is not obvious. As for CO concentration in Figure 11b, it has a faster growth rate at the initial stage and a decreasing growth rate at the later stage, which gradually approach saturation stage. Moreover, CO2 and CO contamination under metal contamination defect on the insulator surface are much lower than those under air gap defects. The partial discharge under contamination defect only occurs on the surface of epoxy resin, while the partial discharge under air gap defect develops through the entire epoxy resin, which leads to more severe deterioration of insulation materials and excitation of more C atoms. As shown in Figure 11c, the variation trend of NO2 concentration also follows the same growth trend as the air gap defect, but it is higher than that under air gap defects. The gas production rate of NO2 shows a nearly linear increase in the first 4 h. In the initial stage, the volume fraction of NO2 is approximately proportional to the partial discharge time because of the stable partial discharge. The N2 and O2 molecules are collided with the accelerated charged particles, while N atoms and O atoms are generated. Then, N atoms react with O, O2 and O3 under the oxidative reaction to produce NO and NO2. With the partial discharge time increasing, NO2 would be oxidized and consumed by enough O3, which generates NO3 and N2O5, and the gas production rate of NO2 also begins to decrease due to the saturation of the volume fraction. Although NO3 and N2O5 are chemically unstable and a part of NO3 and N2O5 would further decompose into NO and NO2, the gas consumption rate of NO2 keeps on increasing. When the gas production rate and gas consumption rate reaches the balance, the NO2 concentration shows a trend of saturation growth.",

Firstly, the electrodes are polished by 3000-mesh sandpaper and cleaned by anhydrous alcohol, which could avoid the effect of particulate. Then experimental electrodes or defects are installed according to various experimental demands. The experimental device is evacuated below 10 Pa using a vacuum pump, and it is filled with CO2 or dry air to 0.1 MPa. The above process is repeated three times to eliminate the influence of other gases and moisture. According to Dalton's Law, different mixing ratios are calculated before gas mixture process. Then, the lower content partial component gases is filled into the test chamber, and the higher contend partial component gases is filled after that. Completing the gas mixture process, the test chamber must be static for more than 12 h to ensure the gas mixtures are well mixed. The AC voltage is applied to the experimental device, and the breakdown experiment or partial discharge experiment is conducted30. Furthermore, the experimental voltage rise at a voltage ramp rate of 0.5 kV/s and the time interval between two gas breakdown processes is 5 min. The breakdown experiments are repeated five times, and the average value is considered as the breakdown voltage. It is worth noting that the mixing ratio is equal to the ratio of partial pressure. For the C4F7N/CO2 mixture, C4F7N is filled in first up to the desired partial pressure and then CO2 is topped up as the carrier gas to guarantee the adequate mixture. In terms of partial discharge experiments, the decomposition products detection is accomplished under different discharge times and applied voltage amplitudes, while the sampling is recorded every 4 h with 2 min gas circulate by on-line infrared gas analyzer TY-6300.",

      "content": "Expanded metal mesh is, in fact, widely used for facades due to its strength, flexibility, and aesthetic appeal. It offers a modern, textured look, while also providing functional benefits like natural ventilation, sun shading, and durability. Key benefits for facades 1 Aesthetic appeal. Expanded metal mesh creates a striking visual effect, adding texture and depth to a building’s exterior. The pattern can give the facade a dynamic, modern look that changes with light and angle. 2 Natural ventilation. The open pattern allows air to flow through the facade, which helps improve ventilation inside the building. This makes it a popular choice for structures needing airflow, such as parking garages, sports arenas, or industrial buildings. 3 Sun shading and energy efficiency. Expanded metal mesh acts as a sunshade, reducing direct sunlight and helping to lower interior temperatures. This shading effect improves energy efficiency, reducing cooling costs and providing added comfort. 4 Durability and low maintenance. Expanded metal facades are highly durable and resistant to weather conditions. They are made from materials like aluminium, stainless steel, or coated steel, which are corrosion-resistant and require minimal maintenance. 5 Sustainability. Expanded metal mesh is often made from recyclable materials and uses minimal metal due to its manufacturing process. It can also support energy-saving efforts by reducing the need for artificial cooling, making it an environmentally friendly choice.",

In contemporary architecture, expanded metal has been used as an exposed facade or screen material which can be formed into simple or complex decorative shapes. Photographic images may be printed on the surface, producing textures or large graphic images, which still allow light to filter through the exterior surface of a building. Architectural Applications [edit] When the New Museum in New York City started winning awards for its expanded metal facade in 2021, expanded metal has seen a resurgence as an architectural design element. There are growing uses for it as second facade skin, ceilings, interior cladding, signage, retail design, parking garage screens, equipment screens, and more.",
