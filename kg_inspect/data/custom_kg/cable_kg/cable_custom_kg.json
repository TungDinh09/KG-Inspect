The \"cable swap\" defect is characterized by incorrect positioning of the insulated conductors within the electrical cable, where conductors that should have specific color-coded insulation are found in incorrect locations, leading to color mismatches with the expected pattern. This misplacement affects the clarity of identification for electrical connections, potentially posing operational risks during installation or usage. Visual features indicating a swap include differing insulation colors that do not align with standard configurations. The \"missing wire\" defect is noted by the absence of one or more metallic strands within the conductor's central core, resulting in visible voids where the wires are expected to be tightly bundled. This absence is critical as it compromises the cable's electrical integrity and performance, making it prone to failure under load. The combination of these defects can severely impact the functionality and safety of the electrical cable, necessitating corrective measures before usage.",

      "content": "Abstract Along with advancements in superconducting technology, especially in high-temperature superconductors (HTSs), the use of these materials in power system applications is gaining outstanding attention. Due to the lower weight, capability of carrying higher currents, and the lower loss characteristic of HTS cables, compared to conventional counterparts, they are among the most focused large-scale applications of superconductors in power systems and transportation units. In near future, these cables will be installed as key elements not only in power systems but also in cryo-electrified transportation units, that take advantage of both cryogenics and superconducting technology simultaneously, e.g., hydrogen-powered aircraft. Given the sensitivity of the reliable and continuous performance of HTS cables, any failures, caused by faults, could be catastrophic, if they are not designed appropriately. Thus, fault analysis of superconducting cables is crucial for ensuring their safety, reliability, and stability, and also for characterising the behaviour of HTS cables under fault currents at the design stage. Many investigations have been conducted on the fault characterisation and analysis of HTS cables in the last few years. This paper aims to provide a topical review on all of these conducted studies, and will discuss the current challenges of HTS cables and after that current developments of fault behaviour of HTS cables will be presented, and then we will discuss the future trends and future challenges of superconducting cables regarding their fault performance.

HTSmaterials would also play a key role in upcoming power grids and cryo-electrified transporta-tion units (CETU) [23]. It was anticipated that HTS cables will be fully commercialised by 2030 [24]. HTS cables have numerous advantages against their con-ventional counterparts, such as extremely low resistive losses, 5× to 8× compacter structure, fault current limiting capab-ility, etc. [25]. Given the potential role of the HTS cable in future, acquiring a complete understanding of their behaviour under different circumstances is crucial. The occurrence of faults, failures, and abnormalities in the cable itself or in the power system to which the cable is connected, can jeopardise the appropriate functionality of HTS cables. Thus, the fault performance study of HTS cables is vital to analyse the elec-tromagnetic coupled with thermomechanical characteristics of HTS cables. High fault currents, i.e., low impedance faults can dramatically jeopardise the safe operation of HTS tapes and without a proper protection or a fault current limiter device, the burnout of HTS tapes is most likely. In some specific HTS cables, former is designed as a bypass path to keep HTS tapes safe in the case of short circuit events or SFCLs are loc-ated in series with HTS cable to supress the fault current. By passing fault current through the former layer and supercon-ducting layer, an excessive heat load will be imposed on the cooling system. Extra heat load increases the temperature of the cable which should be compensated, otherwise, failure of cable or tapes is inevitable. As a result, reliability and avail-ability issues put the stability of the power grid in danger. Therefore, fault analysis of HTS cables plays a significant role in achieving a power grid with high safety, stability, and reliability [26]. ",

High Resistance of Conductor - Prior to a conductor severing, a stranded conductor will most likely initially see individual strands break. As individual strands break, the resistance of the conductor will increase. This can lead to two possible failure modes: 1) The conductor strands will continue to break until a complete break occurs, or 2) The higher resistance will begin to create heat and will eventually overheat causing a localized burn point leading to a break in the conductor.

Various testing and diagnostic techniques are used depending on the type and location of the fault. Visual Inspection A basic but essential step in fault detection, visual inspection involves examining the cable’s outer sheath and termination points for signs of physical damage, wear, or corrosion. Although it cannot identify internal issues, it helps detect obvious causes such as cuts or abrasions. ",

The cores are stranded several times and therefore change the inner and outer radius of the bent cable several times at the same distance. This ensures that the tensile and compression forces are compensated and significantly extends the service life of a cable. Insulation damage Insulation damage can cause short circuits in electrical cables due to damage to the insulation around the conductor. This can be caused by material fatigue under continuous bending stress or material abrasion within the stranded structure. Single wire breaks in the conductor or the braided shielding lead to puncturing of the insulation. ",

If the shield can be easily pushed over the jacket after the stripping process, this is a sign that the cable is not suitable for use in energy supply systems. ",

Perforation of insulation material can occur if conductor strands begin to break or sever and perforate the insulation wall. 3.

Cuts/Cut-through - Impact or contact with sharp objects can lead to cuts in the jacket. Minor cuts that are only superficially on the jacket typically do not impact cable performance. Cuts that impair jacket performance or penetrate down to the shield or cable core are a reason for either repair or replacement of the cable. ",
